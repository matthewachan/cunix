## Course Description

An intensive course designed to develop logic and programming skills through immersion in the fundamentals of C. Programming projects involving mathematical problems and word games challenge students to develop their logical reasoning, systematic thinking, and problem-solving skills. Students learn the structure and features of a fundamental programming language as they implement solutions in C. In addition to teaching programming techniques, the course will cover an overview of fundamental computing concepts such as data structures, library design, and memory management.
