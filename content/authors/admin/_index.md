I am a graduate research assistant at Columbia's Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab. My research interests include computer graphics, physically-based animation, and AR/VR. In addition to research, I also love teaching computer science courses at Columbia -- the most recent being a course on data structures and algorithms in C!
