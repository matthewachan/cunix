Programming projects involving mathematical problems and word games challenge students to develop their logical reasoning, systematic thinking, and problem-solving skills. Students learn the structure and features of a fundamental programming language as they implement solutions in C. In addition to teaching programming techniques, the course will cover an overview of fundamental computing concepts such as data structures, library design, and memory management.\nMore info at the course website here.\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"59c3ce8e202293146a8a934d37a4070b","permalink":"/courses/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/example/","section":"courses","summary":"An intensive course designed to develop logic and programming skills through immersion in the fundamentals of C.","tags":null,"title":"Overview","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"No previous programming experience is required, but participants should have an aptitude for logical reasoning and systematic thinking.\nParticipants are expected to bring laptops for this class.
